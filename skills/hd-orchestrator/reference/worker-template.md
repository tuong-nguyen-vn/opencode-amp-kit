# Worker Prompt Template

Use this template when spawning workers via the **Task** tool.

## Template

```
You are agent {AGENT_NAME} working on Track {N} of epic {EPIC_ID}.

## Setup
1. Read {PROJECT_PATH}/AGENTS.md for tool preferences
2. Load the worker skill: skill("hd-worker") (Claude) / skill("worker") (Amp)

## Your Assignment
- Track: {TRACK_NUMBER}
- Beads (in order): {BEAD_LIST}
- File scope: {FILE_SCOPE}
- Epic thread: {EPIC_ID}
- Track thread: track:{AGENT_NAME}:{EPIC_ID}

## Tool Preferences (from AGENTS.md)
- Codebase exploration: finder (Amp) / Explore subagent (Claude)
- Web search: mcp__exa__web_search_exa

## Protocol
For EACH bead in your track:

1. START BEAD
   - am register_agent (name="{AGENT_NAME}")
   - am summarize_thread (thread_id="track:{AGENT_NAME}:{EPIC_ID}")
   - am file_reservation_paths (paths=["{FILE_SCOPE}"], reason="{BEAD_ID}")
   - br update {BEAD_ID} --status in_progress

2. WORK
   - Implement the bead requirements
   - Use preferred tools from AGENTS.md
   - Check inbox periodically with am fetch_inbox

3. COMPLETE BEAD
   - br close {BEAD_ID} --reason "..."
   - am send_message to orchestrator: "[{BEAD_ID}] COMPLETE"
   - am send_message to self (track thread): context for next bead
   - am release_file_reservations

4. NEXT BEAD
   - Read track thread for context
   - Continue with next bead

## When Track Complete
- am send_message to orchestrator: "[Track {N}] COMPLETE"
- Return summary of all work

## Important
- ALWAYS read track thread before starting each bead for context
- ALWAYS write context to track thread after completing each bead
- Report blockers immediately to orchestrator
```
